- price value should be bigger
- lots of vacant white space, should eliminate that
- zoom on product image when hovered
- add lazy loading
- haloween themed button with a promotion
- size guide button for better UX
- you may also like shift below the main images
- try try in 3d mode
- add name of product and price below the model image. tbh I don't see the need for this.
- shift the free shipping, free exchange section at the end


ux issues 
- inconsistent navbars for desktop and mobile view
