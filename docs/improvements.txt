- price value should be bigger
- lots of vacant white space, should eliminate that
- zoom on product image when hovered
- add lazy loading
- haloween themed button with a promotion
- size guide button for better UX
- you may also like shift below the main images
- try try in 3d mode
- add name of product and price below the model image. tbh I don't see the need for this.
- shift the free shipping, free exchange section at the end
- in the images there should be atleast one picture of a model wearing it. not all the products have it. 

- future scope -> add a reviews and rating of product section maybe

ux issues 
- inconsistent navbars for desktop and mobile view
- the product image cuts and not fully visible. can improve on this by reducing the height
- quantity of cloth is missing in mobile view
- smooth transition of accordon
- zoom on image mention about quick fix and original approch tried how its better than current one
